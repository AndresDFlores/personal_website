                A Bit About Me
            </h1>


            <p class="anim">
                <br>As a passionate and motivated engineer, I’m constantly striving to expand my personal and technical skillset through opportunities that allow me to meaningfully contribute to a product.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="anim">
                <br>I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Florida and began my professional career as a controls engineer in the defense industry.  I became fascinated with data while designing data processing algorithms, viewing the design process as a careful orchestration by which context is given to observation.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="anim">
                <br>Transitioning to a software-facing career while honoring my responsibilities as a mechanical engineer, I sought mentorship from those with similar career trajectories while building programming proficiency outside of work.  I pivoted my career to data engineering after building working knowledge in Python and databases while leveraging my experience with data processing algorithm design as a controls engineer.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="anim">
                <br>As a data engineer, I have developed and implemented scalable database architectures in the defense and banking industries, designed and automated ETL workflows, and produced data exploration and visualization tools.  My work in data engineering has also afforded me the opportunity to design in on-premises and cloud environments, and build data visualization dashboards for various users.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="anim">
                <br>Carefully curated data has the power to demystify unknowns, and data engineering allows society to understand our world beyond superficial observation.  As a multi-faceted engineer, I strive to apply my technical skillset to a career dedicated to discovery through data.<br>
            </p>

            <p class="anim">
                <br>Let's learn more about our world together!<br>
